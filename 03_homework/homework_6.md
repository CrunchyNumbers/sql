**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Reflecting on my learning of SQL, I have truly enjoyed the journey of gaining practical experience with various aspects of the language. The process of mastering data manipulation, including managing NULL values and performing intricate string manipulations, has been incredibly exciting. I have also developed skills in importing and exporting data from and as CSV/JSON files, which has allowed me to handle data more effectively and integrate it seamlessly into different workflows. The extensive data analysis work has deepened my understanding of data structures and enhanced my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, opposing the data and business (real-world) context. Thomas and team did a remarkable job delivering the module, and I deeply appreciate the invaluable experience and knowledge I have gained.

One significant lesson that resonated with me during the course was from an article about Pakistan's national database. It highlighted a crucial principle: "Good database design does not need to predict what will happen 20 years in the future, but needs to acknowledge there will be change." This example taught me the importance of designing databases with flexibility and adaptability in mind, ensuring they can evolve with changing requirements and technologies. This perspective has been instrumental in shaping my approach to data engineering, emphasizing the need for robust yet adaptable database architectures.

In my previous projects, I have focused heavily on technical proficiency and data accuracy. However, I recognize the importance of incorporating ethics and equity components into data analysis and database management. Ethical considerations in data handling are crucial to ensure that data is used responsibly and that the privacy and rights of individuals are respected. Moving forward, I would implement strict data governance policies that ensure data is collected, stored, and analyzed in compliance with legal requirements and ethical guidelines. This includes obtaining proper consent for data usage and ensuring that sensitive information is anonymized or protected.

In addressing issues of equity, it is essential to be aware of and actively counteract biases that may exist in the data or be introduced through analysis processes. This involves being vigilant about the sources of data and the potential for these sources to reflect systemic biases. I would incorporate fairness checks in my data analysis pipeline to identify and mitigate any disparities that may affect the outcomes of the analysis. This could involve using statistical techniques to detect bias and implementing corrective measures to ensure that the conclusions drawn from the data are equitable and just (looking forward to the statistical module to learn the nuances).

Overall, the combination of technical skills and ethical considerations will enable me to perform data analysis in a manner that is both proficient and socially responsible. The training I received has provided a strong foundation, and I am committed to applying these principles to promote fairness and integrity in all future projects. The module has generally helped me better understand the basic concepts of data engineering, preparing me to handle future challenges with a comprehensive and thoughtful approach.
